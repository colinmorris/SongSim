You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
It don't take too much high IQ's 
To see what you're doing to me
You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think) 
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
Oh, freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom)
Oh, freedom, yeah, freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom)
Freedom, oh freedom
Hey, think about it, think about it
There ain't nothing you could ask 
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not 
To keep doing things I don't
You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
People walking around everyday 
Playing games, taking score
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Ah, be careful you don't lose yours, oh
Think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me, ooh
Think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
You need me (need me) 
And I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing people can do, oh
Think about it, baby (What are you trying to do me)
Yeah, oh baby, think about it now, yeah
(Think about, ah me, think about, ah me)
(Think about, ah me, think about, ah me)
Oh, come on, baby
