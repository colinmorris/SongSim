Half past twelve
Watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Autumn winds blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

Movie stars
On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in

Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
