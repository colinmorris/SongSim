Jimmy Mack Jimmy, 
Oh Jimmy Mack when are you comin' back.
Jimmy Mack Jimmy, 
Oh Jimmy Mack when are you comin' back.
My arms are missing you,
My lips feel the same way too.
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised to do.
But this boy keeps comin' around, 
tryin' to wear my resistance down.
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, 
Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Oh Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back.
He calls me on the phone about three times a day.
Now my heart's just listening to, what he has to say
But this loneliness I have within,
Keeps reaching out to be his friend
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, 
Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Oh Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back.
Need your loving, need your loving.
I wanna say I'm not getting any stronger,
I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard, to be true, 
But, Jimmy he talks just as sweet as you.
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, 
Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Oh Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back.
