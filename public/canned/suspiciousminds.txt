We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (Suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

But here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (Suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Whoa, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I have never lied to you
Mmm, yeah, yeah

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

Well, don't you know I'm, I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm, I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm, I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
