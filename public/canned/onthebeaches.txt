Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and 
famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip 
of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi 
rule, we shall not flag or fail.

We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, 
we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight 
with growing confidence and growing strength in the 
air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may 
be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on 
the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and 
in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall 
never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a 
moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were 
subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the 
seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would 
carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the 
New World, with all its power and might, steps forth 
to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
