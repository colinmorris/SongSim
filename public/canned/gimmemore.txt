Every time they turn the lights down
Just want to go that extra mile for you
You public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Keep watching

Feels like the crowd is saying

Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More

A center of attention (Can you feel them?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You've got me in a crazy position (yeah)
If you're on a mission (uh-uh)
You got my permission (oh)

We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
We'll keep on rockin', rockin' (Oh ah ha)
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Keep watching

Feel's like the crowd is saying:

Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more

Gimme, Gimme, More

Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More (Gimme more)
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More (Oh woah oh!)
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more (Gimme more, yeah)
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More

Give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more babe (Danja Danja, Danj)
I just want more!

The incredible ligo
The legendary Ms. Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
You're gonna have to remove me
Cause I ain't goin nowhere
