You can paint me any color
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down

Now I got your back up
What do you not like
Do you think I'm stuck-up
'Cause I'm always picking fights
You might think I'm one thing,
But I am another
You can't call my bluff
Time to back off, motherfucker

Do you really want me to write a feminist anthem
I'm happy cooking dinner in the kitchen for my husband
Yeah, yeah

You can paint me any color
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down

You ain't got me sussed yet
You're not even close
Baby, it's the one thing
That I hate the most
All these contradictions pouring out of me
Just another girl in the 21st century

I am never gonna give you anything you expect
You think I'm like the others
Boy, you need to get your eyes checked, checked

You can paint me any color
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down

I could be your sister
I could be your mother
I could be your neighbour
I could be your lover
Do you like my body?
Do you like my mind?
What is it that you are having trouble to define?

I am never gonna give you anything you expect
You think I'm like the others
Boy, you need to get your eyes checked, checked

You can paint me any color
I can be your Russian doll
But you ain't got my number
No, you can't make me small
You can paint me any color
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
Yeah, you can't pin me down
