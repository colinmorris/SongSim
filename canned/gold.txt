You've got it in the palm of your hands
It's slipping through your fingers like sand
'Cause they don't understand who you are
Doesn't matter as long as I am your star, star

Yeah, I know that I need the gold
But what I love can't be bought or sold

Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I need what I used to need
Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I see what I used to see

I've been waiting, waiting for the penny to drop
I've been working, working to get back what I lost, I lost
But whatever happens, I'll be okay
'Cause fortune's running out of my veins, my veins

You can't take away the Midas' touch
So you better make a way for a Greek gold rush

Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I need what I used to need
Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I see what I used to see

In El Dorado, your gold
To Colorado can't be bought or sold

Now, there's no moral to this story
But I can hear my freedom calling me, calling me

I don't care that everybody knows
I'm a million dollars in the hole
I don't care that everybody knows
Baby, I don't even want your gold

From El Dorado, your gold
To Colorado can't be bought or sold

Gold rush
Gold rush
Free, free, free, free, free, I am free
