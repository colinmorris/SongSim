This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for make-up, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star 
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star 
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Best actress, and the winner is Lucky
I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky
Oh my god here she comes

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

And they say she's so lucky, she's a star 
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

She's so lucky 
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?
