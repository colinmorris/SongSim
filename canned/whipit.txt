Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back

When a problem comes along (You must whip it)
Before the cream sits out too long (You must whip it)
When something's going wrong (You must whip it)

Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good!

When a good time turns around (You must whip it)
You will never live it down (Unless you whip it)
No one gets away (Until they whip it)

I say whip it
Whip it good!
I say whip it
Whip it good!

Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back

When a problem comes along (You must whip it)
Before the cream sits out too long (You must whip it)
When something's going wrong (You must whip it)

Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it

Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good!
