You went to school to learn girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like "I" before "E" except after "C"
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now, now, now

All about love girl
(All about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

But listen without the roots of love everyday girl
Your education ain't complete
