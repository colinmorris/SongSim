You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I likn what I hear
And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You've got me for you prey

Yeah Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but Yeah leave a message
And I'll call you back

You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please let me be

Communication, a telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape...

Yeah Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message 
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but Yeah leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Now it's gone to deep Now, it's gone too deep
You wake me in my sleep Wake me in my sleep
My dreams become nightmares Dreams become nightmares
'Cause you're ringing in my ears

Yeah Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but Yeah leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter-matter-matter-matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Oooh, the spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back

So, leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walkink into spiderwebs
It's all your fault, no mattter who calls

No matter who calls, no matter who calls
