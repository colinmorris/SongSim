Something I can hold on to

We girls gonna run this, run this

Down with the rhythm on another beat
Gotta take that back what you said to me
Never giving in when the sun's so high
Gotta feel that heat when you call, say bye
Down with the rhythm on another street
Gotta let this go cause I feel so free
Never giving in cause I need you here, ah, ah

Something I can hold on to
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna dance
Baby let it drop
Catch me if you can

Cause we're the leaders of the pack

Take a walk on the wild side of life, life
(Head over heels, we're out of time)
Take a walk on the wild side of life, life
Bring it back to the other side

Feel the beat deep underground
Boy tonight it's getting loud
We can go, go anywhere
We don't care, let me take it higher
We can do, do anything
Play the game and maybe you'll win
Boy tonight you can't hold me back
Do what I want, yeah I like it that

Something I can hold on to
I don't wanna talk

Baby let it drop
