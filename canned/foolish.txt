See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 
See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 

Baby I don't know why ya treat me so bad 
You said you loved me, no one above me 
And I was all you had 
And though my heart is beating for ya
I can't stop crying 
I don't know how
I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay 

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 
See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 

Baby I don't know why ya wanna do me wrong
See when I'm home, I'm all alone 
And you are always gone 
And boy, you know I really love you 
I can't deny 
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears 
After all these years 

See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 
See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 
Oohhhhh
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad 
What love will make you do 
All the things that we accept 
Be the things that we regret 
Too all of my ladies (ladies) feel me 
C'mon sing wit me 
See, when I get the strength to leave you
Always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that may be
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change 
(never gonna change, never gonna change)
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more 
I keep on running back to you 
See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you 

Baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me 
Boy I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go 
Even when I pack my bags
See something always hold me back
