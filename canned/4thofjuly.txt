Didn't think I needed you
Never seemed to
Now I'm living proof
And now I'm brand new
Rename me
Baby, you can claim me
I've been changed, see
You make me over
You make me over
Didn't think I needed you
Never seemed to
Now I'm living proof (living proof)

Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you

You make me high
You make me high
You make me high
You make me high
You make me high (and I don't wanna come down)
You make me high (and I don't wanna come down)

You make me high (and I don't wanna come down)
