Worlds fly by
Drove by your place and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
And I can't lie
I like the feeling, how you make me shy
I share my secrets and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two

Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, boy you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

Eyes so bright
You got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn but still I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
Why when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat breaking through?
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Fall into me now

Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, boy you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

(Gimmie love)

It's the way we are together
Wanna feel like this forever
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever
Say forever

Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch (oh touch me)
Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, boy you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
