Aye Yo...
You don't have to love me...
You don't even have to like me...
But you will respect me...

You know why cause I'm a boss

You know, it's a hard pill to swallow
When they tell you you strange
You ain't hot
Then in the blink of an eye
They got on what you got
That means I'm a boss!

Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch that beat go...

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stakes
I told John Sterling he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

Ooh lemme slow it down so ya can catch the flow
Screw it up make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the flow
(On the flow get down, on the flow)
Ooh I gave you a taste you want some more
Touch down I got on it like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gonna keep it pumpin while the 808 is jumpin'

Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stakes
I told john sterling he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh (I bet I bet I bet)
I betcha never heard it like this before
My baby be closin' them phantom doors
Got the bar poppin' this that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh I'm drinkin blastin the crowds it's all smokin'
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls we stay fly and we love to stay high
Ooh from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
To the money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it pumpin while the 808 is jumpin'

Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick ya'll love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

It's bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin', she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt em
If niggas don't back back, you gon' work em
Put your mack down, I know your background
Whatchu want girl, you gettin' mad now
That's how you do it, huh?
Well I'm the coolest one
In fact, bitches in the back bring 'em to the front, bitch!
Tell that man you's a boss bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understand you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash mayne
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin, you say "How much it cost me?"
About a million dollars playa, she's bossy

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told John Sterling he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy
