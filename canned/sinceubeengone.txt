Here's the thing
We started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say


But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

How come I've never heard you say
I just want to be with you?
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again, and again, and again, and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want

I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
